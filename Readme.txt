The program first draws a customer database, which is printed on the screen. You can grab the customer's name and PIN and make withdrawals. In addition, the name is asked. The system draws an account number and PIN code for the name, as well as an imaginary balance. The “Insert Card” function has been changed to the “Enter Name” function. The account numbers have been changed to correspond to the correct IBAN account numbers. Because the numbers in this case become so large that normal C functions cannot perform calculations due to an overflow, the program has used (because I couldn't do these myself) the BigInt.c and BigInt.h files made by ilia301. I copied these from the website https://github.com/ilia3101/Big-Integer-C. Ilia301 has exploited Kokke's tiny-bignum-c code (https://github.com/kokke/tiny-bignum-c). The bank's customer account information is kept in a struct structure called CustomerInfo, which has three char-type string variables: name, pin, and account, i.e., name, PIN, and account number. In addition, there is a double-type member balance that includes the customer's account balance.Customer names have been drawn from string tables containing first names and surnames.The four-digit PIN is drawn from the Digits string table, which contains the string “0123456789”.
